;; TODO

;; This should be turned into an error at the expander layer instead
;; of errors in later passes.
;;
;; We have decided to enforce a syntactic restriction that first class
;; relations may not have free logic variable references.
;;
;; This potentially makes the feature less expressive, and maybe some
;; day weâ€™ll go in and add back that expressivity, but for now this
;; makes the compiler passes easier because under this restriction,
;; the pass gets to see the binding of every logic variable.
